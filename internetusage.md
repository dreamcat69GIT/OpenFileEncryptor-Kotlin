# OpenFileEncryptor Internet Usage Policy

This program requires internet access only for two specific functions:

1. **Crash Reporting**  
   When the program encounters errors, anonymous crash reports are sent to Supabase. These reports contain only technical information needed to fix bugs.

2. **Update Checks**  
   The program connects to GitHub to check for available updates. This only happens when you manually trigger an update check.

All encryption/decryption operations happen offline. Your files and encryption keys never leave your computer and are never transmitted online.

No other internet communication occurs. No user data, file contents, or encryption material is collected or transmitted.
